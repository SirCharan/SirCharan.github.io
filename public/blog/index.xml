      <description>It has been played around for a long time by many people claiming to be &amp;ldquo;SEO experts&amp;rdquo;, but Google has now given a final wording on the topic.
 Specific Keyword Density is NOT a ranking factor.
 In fact, Google has even gone on record to say that it does NOT even pay attention to keyword density!
In the words of Matt Cutts, former spokesperson for Google, addressing the issue.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s Justin Timberlake, McDonald&amp;rsquo;s and the $6 Million (Rs. 45 crore) deal you don&amp;rsquo;t know about! Just close your eyes for a second, and try to picture the McDonald&amp;rsquo;s logo.I&amp;rsquo;m sure the image of the curved yellow coloured 〽️ pops up in your mind right?
And if I tell you to remember their slogan, I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you would be able to recall the famous &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Loving It&amp;rdquo;.
This is the power of branding.</description>

      <description>JioMeet vs. Zoom: A poor copy Or a brilliant marketing tactic? Many of you made memes of it and called it a copy.
And many of you tried to defend the move.
But with all the publicity it has already received, I don&amp;rsquo;t think Jio has to spend another penny in advertising.
And anyway, wasn&amp;rsquo;t U.G.C. always the best form of marketing? 😝
PS: Just waiting for a tweet from Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani &amp;ldquo;Honestly, I did it for the memes!</description>

      <description>Ever wondered why popcorn is priced 10x more expensive at movie theatres?
Movie theatres earn only 5% revenue from ticket sales, most of the money you pay as ticket fees goes to the filmmakers.So how do movie theatres earn money?
The simple answer-Popcorn!
And hotdogs and burgers and cola and everything else they sell at 10x its original price.
They ban you from bringing in food from outside, and sell their own products at inflated prices to drive tons of revenue.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything wrong, but somehow, we lost&amp;rdquo; These were the last words of Stephen Elop, CEO, Nokia before stepping down. Some of the most heartbreaking words I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard.
Nokia. They were the number 1 mobile phone brand a while back, and in 2007, more than 50% of all phones sold were Nokia!
The most strongest, sturdiest and best phone the world had ever seen.
They had the world at their feet.</description>
