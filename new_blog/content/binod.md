Binod.

A Youtube comment that made the news.

A Youtube comment that ruled the internet.

A Youtube comment that made Paytm change its official username on Twitter.

Binod.

Can it get any further? I guess not.

Where did it all start?

Well,

A popular YouTube channel Slayy Point released a video "𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗮𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗚𝗮𝗿𝗯𝗮𝗴𝗲 (𝗕𝗜𝗡𝗢𝗗)" showcasing the person by name of Binod Thaur leaving a single comment "Binod" everywhere.

Yes.

Just that.

Binod.

And it went viral.

Just like that.

Viral.

YouTube was flooded with many other users changing their names to Binod Thaur and commenting "Binod" everywhere.

This soon caught up to Facebook and other social media.

To top it all, a Twitter user with the handle @Gabbarsingh even asked Paytm to change its name to Binod.

And the leading Indian mobile payment platform replied with a "Done."!!

And actually did it!!

😲

Crazy?

Wait here's more!

The #binodmemes is trending on Twitter now too...

I'm sure foreigners would still be trying to figure out who this guy is and why is he trending...

😂

Does this seem enough, or do you think it goes on?

PS: The screenshot is original, and unedited. They actually did it.
