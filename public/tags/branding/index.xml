      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s Justin Timberlake, McDonald&amp;rsquo;s and the $6 Million (Rs. 45 crore) deal you don&amp;rsquo;t know about! Just close your eyes for a second, and try to picture the McDonald&amp;rsquo;s logo.I&amp;rsquo;m sure the image of the curved yellow coloured 〽️ pops up in your mind right?
And if I tell you to remember their slogan, I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you would be able to recall the famous &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Loving It&amp;rdquo;.
This is the power of branding.</description>

      <description>Binod. A Youtube comment that made the news.
A Youtube comment that ruled the internet.
A Youtube comment that made Paytm change its official username on Twitter.
Binod. Can it get any further? I guess not.
Where did it all start? Well,
A popular YouTube channel Slayy Point released a video &amp;ldquo;𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗮𝗻 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗚𝗮𝗿𝗯𝗮𝗴𝗲 (𝗕𝗜𝗡𝗢𝗗)&amp;rdquo; showcasing the person by name of Binod Thaur leaving a single comment &amp;ldquo;Binod&amp;rdquo; everywhere.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything wrong, but somehow, we lost&amp;rdquo; These were the last words of Stephen Elop, CEO, Nokia before stepping down. Some of the most heartbreaking words I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard.
Nokia. They were the number 1 mobile phone brand a while back, and in 2007, more than 50% of all phones sold were Nokia!
The most strongest, sturdiest and best phone the world had ever seen.
They had the world at their feet.</description>
