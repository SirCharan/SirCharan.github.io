      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s Justin Timberlake, McDonald&amp;rsquo;s and the $6 Million (Rs. 45 crore) deal you don&amp;rsquo;t know about! Just close your eyes for a second, and try to picture the McDonald&amp;rsquo;s logo.I&amp;rsquo;m sure the image of the curved yellow coloured „ÄΩÔ∏è pops up in your mind right?
And if I tell you to remember their slogan, I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you would be able to recall the famous &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Loving It&amp;rdquo;.
This is the power of branding.</description>

      <description>JioMeet vs. Zoom: A poor copy Or a brilliant marketing tactic? Many of you made memes of it and called it a copy.
And many of you tried to defend the move.
But with all the publicity it has already received, I don&amp;rsquo;t think Jio has to spend another penny in advertising.
And anyway, wasn&amp;rsquo;t U.G.C. always the best form of marketing? üòù
PS: Just waiting for a tweet from Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani &amp;ldquo;Honestly, I did it for the memes!</description>

      <description>The fake 20$ marketing campaign that made millions: A landmowing company in the USA found a very innovative way of advertising its services.
They did not place their advertisements on billboards, neither did they spend a fortune on TV ads.
Instead, they used a very simple trick to lure their customers.
They made fake 20$ bills, placed their company advertisements on it and placed them in front of lawns of people that needed mowing!</description>
