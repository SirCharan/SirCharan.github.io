The fake 20$ marketing campaign that made millions:

A landmowing company in the USA found a very innovative way of advertising its services.

They did not place their advertisements on billboards, neither did they spend a fortune on TV ads.

Instead, they used a very simple trick to lure their customers.

They made fake 20$ bills, placed their company advertisements on it and placed them in front of lawns of people that needed mowing!
