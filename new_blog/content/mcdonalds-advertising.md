Justin Timberlake, McDonald's and the $6 Million (Rs. 45 crore) deal you don't know about!

Just close your eyes for a second, and try to picture the McDonald's logo.I'm sure the image of the curved yellow coloured „ÄΩÔ∏è pops up in your mind right?

And if I tell you to remember their slogan, I'm sure most of you would be able to recall the famous "I'm Loving It".

This is the power of branding.

It has made McDonald's a leading fast-food chain and almost a household name today

But this wasn't always the case. In 2003, its business was in trouble.

It needed a change of fortune.

It held a competition between the 14 largest international #advertising agencies in the world.The winner came up with the idea of "I'm Loving It" slogan.

And in late 2003, a new star, Justin Timberlake gave it his voice for $6million.

They spent 1.3 billion on its marketing. 

That marketing campaign made it the fast-food giant it is today.

You think they overspent?
You think McDonald's branding isn't strong enough?

Then just close your eyes and try to remember KFC's logo. Are the letters K, F and C in red, black or white?

What about Domino's? 

You don't remember it, right?üòú

That's the importance of branding!
