Cryptocurrencies, also known as digital or virtual currencies, are decentralized digital assets that use cryptography for security and operate independently of a central bank. In this blog post, we will discuss the various use cases of cryptocurrencies and the problems they can solve. We will focus on the Indian audience and provide relevant examples to help understand the benefits of cryptocurrencies.

What are Cryptocurrencies?[#](#what-are-cryptocurrencies)

Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are decentralized and operate independently of a central bank. They use cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units.

Use Cases of Cryptocurrencies
=============================

\=============================

Cross-Border Payments[#](#cross-border-payments)
------------------------------------------------

One of the primary use cases of cryptocurrencies is cross-border payments. Cross-border payments can be time-consuming, costly, and involve multiple banks and currency exchange processes. Using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, you can make cross-border payments instantly with minimal transaction fees.

Self-Custody[#](#self-custody)

Protection Against Inflation[#](#protection-against-inflation)
