      <description>Ever wondered why popcorn is priced 10x more expensive at movie theatres?
Movie theatres earn only 5% revenue from ticket sales, most of the money you pay as ticket fees goes to the filmmakers.So how do movie theatres earn money?
The simple answer-Popcorn!
And hotdogs and burgers and cola and everything else they sell at 10x its original price.
They ban you from bringing in food from outside, and sell their own products at inflated prices to drive tons of revenue.</description>

      <description>The fake 20$ marketing campaign that made millions:
A landmowing company in the USA found a very innovative way of advertising its services.
They did not place their advertisements on billboards, neither did they spend a fortune on TV ads.
Instead, they used a very simple trick to lure their customers.
They made fake 20$ bills, placed their company advertisements on it and placed them in front of lawns of people that needed mowing!</description>

      <description>JioMeet vs. Zoom: A poor copy Or a brilliant marketing tactic?
Many of you made memes of it and called it a copy.
And many of you tried to defend the move.
But with all the publicity it has already received, I don&amp;rsquo;t think Jio has to spend another penny in advertising.
And anyway, wasn&amp;rsquo;t U.G.C. always the best form of marketing? 😝
PS: Just waiting for a tweet from Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani *Honestly, I did it for the memes!</description>

      <description>Justin Timberlake, McDonald&amp;rsquo;s and the $6 Million (Rs. 45 crore) deal you don&amp;rsquo;t know about!
Just close your eyes for a second, and try to picture the McDonald&amp;rsquo;s logo.I&amp;rsquo;m sure the image of the curved yellow coloured 〽️ pops up in your mind right?
And if I tell you to remember their slogan, I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you would be able to recall the famous &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Loving It&amp;rdquo;.
This is the power of branding.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything wrong, but somehow, we lost&amp;rdquo; ~ Stephen Elop, CEO, Nokia Some of the most heartbreaking words I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard.
Nokia. They were the number 1 mobile phone brand a while back, and in 2007, more than 50% of all phones sold were Nokia.
The most strongest, sturdiest and best phone the world had ever seen.
They had the world at their feet.
Where did it all go wrong?</description>

      <description>How long is it going to be when someone finally comes up with a simple but genius idea of collaborating OYO Rooms and Tinder?
And while you&amp;rsquo;re at it, maybe get in Manforce and Durex too?
Not all ideas have to be complicated, right?</description>
