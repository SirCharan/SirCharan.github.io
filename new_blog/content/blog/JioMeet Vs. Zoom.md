JioMeet vs. Zoom:
A poor copy
Or a brilliant marketing tactic?

Many of you made memes of it and called it a copy.

And many of you tried to defend the move.

But with all the publicity it has already received, I don't think Jio has to spend another penny in advertising.

And anyway, wasn't U.G.C. always the best form of marketing? üòù

PS: Just waiting for a tweet from Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani *Honestly, I did it for the memes!"

Reminiscing the Tesla Cybertruck launch by Elon Musk.
