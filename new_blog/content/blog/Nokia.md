"We didn't do anything wrong, but somehow, we lost" ~ Stephen Elop, CEO, Nokia
Some of the most heartbreaking words I've ever heard.

Nokia. They were the number 1 mobile phone brand a while back, and in 2007, more than 50% of all phones sold were Nokia.

The most strongest, sturdiest and best phone the world had ever seen.

They had the world at their feet.

Where did it all go wrong?
Their biggest mistake?

They were afraid.
Afraid of making a mistake.

They always stuck to their course. They always did what they do the best.

They were always running miles ahead of everyone.

Until.
Until it all came down.
Until a complete nut job named Steve Jobs came, and made a phone with no keypad, and changed the race itself.

And then Apple, Samsung Electronics, Google and the rest of the smartphone gang came and took over.

And in 2016, the CEO, Stephen Elop, finally admitted “we didn’t do anything wrong, but somehow, we lost.”

He was right, they did nothing wrong.
But sometimes,
Even that isn't enough.

#CKSays: If you're not willing to take risks and make a bet on the unknown, someone else will.
In the end, you'll only regret the chances you didn't take.
