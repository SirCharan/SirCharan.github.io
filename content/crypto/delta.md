# Bitcoin Option Selling Levels: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Expiry

Welcome to our Bitcoin Option Selling Levels blog! Here, we provide you with crucial levels for selling options in Bitcoin for daily, weekly, and monthly expiries with an impressive 84% accuracy. This means that roughly 6 out of 7 times, our levels will be spot-on, helping you make informed trading decisions.

## How to Use Our Levels

Our levels are designed to maximize your trading profits by providing clear guidance on where to sell put and call options:

1. **Sell Put Options Below the Lower Level (Support)**: When the Bitcoin price is below our indicated lower level, it's an ideal time to sell put options. This strategy leverages the likelihood that the price won't drop significantly further, allowing you to profit from the premium received. Selling put options below the support level means you are anticipating that the market will not fall much more and the options will expire worthless, keeping the premium you received.

2. **Sell Call Options Above the Higher Level (Resistance)**: Conversely, when the Bitcoin price is above our indicated higher level, it's the perfect opportunity to sell call options. This approach capitalizes on the probability that the price won't rise substantially higher, enabling you to keep the premium. By selling call options above the resistance level, you are expecting the price to not rise significantly, and thus the options will expire worthless, again allowing you to keep the premium.

## Expiry Levels Provided

- **Daily Expiry Levels**: For traders looking to make quick, short-term trades.
