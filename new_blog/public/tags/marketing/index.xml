      <description>Find Your Popcorn Ever wondered why popcorn is priced 10x more expensive at movie theatres?
Movie theatres earn only 5% revenue from ticket sales, most of the money you pay as ticket fees goes to the filmmakers.So how do movie theatres earn money?
The simple answer-Popcorn!
And hotdogs and burgers and cola and everything else they sell at 10x its original price.
They ban you from bringing in food from outside, and sell their own products at inflated prices to drive tons of revenue.</description>

      <description>Justin Timberlake, McDonald&amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp; The $6 Million deal you don&amp;rsquo;t know about&amp;hellip; Justin Timberlake, McDonald&amp;rsquo;s and the $6 Million (Rs. 45 crore) deal you don&amp;rsquo;t know about!
Just close your eyes for a second, and try to picture the McDonald&amp;rsquo;s logo.I&amp;rsquo;m sure the image of the curved yellow coloured 〽️ pops up in your mind right?
And if I tell you to remember their slogan, I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you would be able to recall the famous &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Loving It&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Nokia &amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything wrong, but somehow, we lost&amp;rdquo; ~ Stephen Elop, CEO, Nokia Some of the most heartbreaking words I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard.
Nokia. They were the number 1 mobile phone brand a while back, and in 2007, more than 50% of all phones sold were Nokia.
The most strongest, sturdiest and best phone the world had ever seen.
They had the world at their feet.
Where did it all go wrong?</description>
