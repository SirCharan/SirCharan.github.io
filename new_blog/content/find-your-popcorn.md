Ever wondered why popcorn is priced 10x more expensive at movie theatres?

Movie theatres earn only 5% revenue from ticket sales, most of the money you pay as ticket fees goes to the filmmakers.So how do movie theatres earn money?

The simple answer-**Popcorn**!

And hotdogs and burgers and cola and everything else they sell at 10x its original price.

They ban you from bringing in food from outside, and sell their own products at inflated prices to drive tons of revenue.

This is called upselling.

Movie tickets don't earn them much revenue, its the popcorn that does...

Other famous examples of upselling side products/services:

**Amazon:** You can pay a normal amount to get something delivered 3-7 days,
or pay an extra charge to get it delivered overnight

**IKEA Group:** You can buy cheap furniture if you wish to assemble it yourself,
but that's tough and more often than not you will end up paying for them to assemble it for you for a much higher price

If you have a business that is not becoming profitable, or your revenues are low or your main product isn't selling,
Its time you stop obsessing about selling your "movie tickets"
And find your "popcorn"!
