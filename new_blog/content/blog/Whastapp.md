Ever wondered how WhatsApp makes money?

Ever wondered how much it makes?

Well, according to Forbes, the figure is around $5 billion!

It never charges you or shows you an ad, then how?

WhatsApp has over 2 billion users, and is expanding at the rate of almost a million users a day!

With almost nil money spent on user acquisition, it has a high market penetration and exponential growth curve.

That makes it an indispensable messaging app for everyone.

It's experiment with the paid version of WhatsApp Business app showed business owners are willing to pay a lot to support their customer communications through the app.

But is it really only this much?

Facebook acquired WhatsApp Inc. in a $19 billion deal in 2016.
One of the biggest claimed rationale behind it was access to user's behavioural data.

With access to your location data, contact list and over 65 billion messages sent per day,
Facebook has tons of data, all uploaded and stored on its servers.

However, Mark Zuckerburg has claimed that this data is not being used in any way for ad targetting🤫

This kind of data is very valuable to big firms and is worth a lot of money🤐

But who knows?

If you're not paying for a product, then YOU are the
product! 😉
