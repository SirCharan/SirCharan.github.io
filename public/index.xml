      <description>I recently had a client, HenryHarvinwho had a HUGE website, and by huge, I mean having more than 4800 webpages! Most of the pages were various course pages and blog pages. Having a good Technical SEO becomes very important for websites with such a large number of webpages, and can cause serious losses in traffic and rankings if it is not structured properly.

      <description>The fake 20$ marketing campaign that made millions: A landmowing company in the USA found a very innovative way of advertising its services.
They did not place their advertisements on billboards, neither did they spend a fortune on TV ads.
Instead, they used a very simple trick to lure their customers.
They made fake 20$ bills, placed their company advertisements on it and placed them in front of lawns of people that needed mowing!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything wrong, but somehow, we lost&amp;rdquo; These were the last words of Stephen Elop, CEO, Nokia before stepping down. Some of the most heartbreaking words I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard.
Nokia. They were the number 1 mobile phone brand a while back, and in 2007, more than 50% of all phones sold were Nokia!
The most strongest, sturdiest and best phone the world had ever seen.
They had the world at their feet.</description>

      <description>JioMeet vs. Zoom: A poor copy Or a brilliant marketing tactic? Many of you made memes of it and called it a copy.
And many of you tried to defend the move.
But with all the publicity it has already received, I don&amp;rsquo;t think Jio has to spend another penny in advertising.
And anyway, wasn&amp;rsquo;t U.G.C. always the best form of marketing? ð
PS: Just waiting for a tweet from Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani &amp;ldquo;Honestly, I did it for the memes!</description>

      <description>Ever wondered why popcorn is priced 10x more expensive at movie theatres?
Movie theatres earn only 5% revenue from ticket sales, most of the money you pay as ticket fees goes to the filmmakers.So how do movie theatres earn money?
The simple answer-Popcorn!
And hotdogs and burgers and cola and everything else they sell at 10x its original price.
They ban you from bringing in food from outside, and sell their own products at inflated prices to drive tons of revenue.</description>
